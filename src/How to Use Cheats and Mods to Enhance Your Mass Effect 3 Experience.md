## How to Use Cheats in Mass Effect 3
  
Cheats in Mass Effect 3 are not enabled by default. You need to edit some files in the game folder to activate them. Before you do that, make sure you backup your original files in case something goes wrong. You also need to download some tools that will help you edit the files.
  
The tools you need are:
  
- [Cheater's Pad](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect3/mods/538/): This mod adds a number of cheat codes that you can activate with your keyboard's numpad. It allows you to toggle god mode, give yourself all weapons and weapon mods, unlock all bonus powers, get all galaxy assets and side missions, max out paragon/renegade points, get extra talent points, level up your character, set credits to 1 million, and give yourself all armor and cabin items[^1^].
- [ME3 Weaponry Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect3/mods/558?tab=docs): This mod lets you edit the properties of each weapon in the game, such as damage, accuracy, recoil, weight, clip size, fire rate, ammo capacity, and more. You can also edit the properties of heavy weapons and weapon upgrades[^2^].
- [Keybinds Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect3/mods/373): This mod allows you to customize your keyboard shortcuts for various actions in the game. You can also use it to bind keys for using unreleased heavy weapons[^2^].
- [Gibbed's Mass Effect 3 Save Editor](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect3/mods/409): This tool allows you to edit your save files and change various aspects of your character and game progress. You can modify your appearance, class, powers, weapons, armor, reputation, war assets, romance options, plot choices, and more[^2^].
- [Mass Effect 3 Coalesced.bin tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect3/mods/373): This tool allows you to decompile and recompile the Coalesced.bin file in the game folder. This file contains many settings and values that affect the game's behavior. You can use it to enable console commands, change difficulty settings, tweak camera angles, adjust HUD elements, and more[^2^].
- [TankMaster's Coalesce Interface](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect3/mods/373): This tool is an alternative to the Mass Effect 3 Coalesced.bin tool. It allows you to edit the Coalesced.bin file in a more user-friendly interface[^2^].

1. Download and install the tools mentioned above.
